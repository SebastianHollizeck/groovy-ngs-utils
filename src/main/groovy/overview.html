<h1>Groovy NGS</h1>

<p>Welcome to Groovy NGS!</p>

<p dir="auto">GNGS is toolkit for working with next genomic sequencing data in Groovy.</p>
<p dir="auto">GNGS aims unlock the power of the JVM for working with genomic data through highly accessible
scripting style use.</p>
<p dir="auto">GNGS works at three levels:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
    <li>Directly as tools on the command line</li>
    <li>For writing simple scripts (bash-style)</li>
    <li>As a library of classes for building full-scale applications</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Examples of functionality supported are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
    <li>Reading, processing and filtering VCF files, including integration with common annotation sources such as VEP</li>
    <li>Working with Genomic Ranges - full set of operation as well as higher level reading, processing and filtering</li>
    <li>Reading, processing and performing logical operations with pedigree (PED) files and family structures</li>
    <li>Working with BAM/SAM/CRAM files (including, generating and working with Pileups)</li>
    <li>A range of statistical operations including R-like data frames and linear modeling constructs</li>
    <li>Many many more useful operations</li>
</ul>
